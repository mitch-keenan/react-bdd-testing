# Intro to BDD testing in React with bdd-lazy-var

This will be an example readme/blog-post stepping through how I arrived at my heavily BDD based testing approach for React and how you can use the fantastic `bdd-lazy-var` package to make testing a breeze!

We'll start at a bare [create-react-app](https://github.com/stalniy/bdd-lazy-var) repo and step through the process to first show the type of tests we end up writing with BDD and then how to apply the `bdd-lazy-var` package to make things easier.
I show code examples for each step of this as well as a link to a diff for the given changes from the last example. Feel free to dive into the repo at anytime as each step is tagged in the repo.
